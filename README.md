The project attached here is sentiment analysis of the reviews given by different people after using different variants of Amazon Alexa. In this project, the sentiment analysis is done on the reviews to predict a review to be positive or negative. For performing this both Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are used and the testing and training accuracies are compared and it is observed that although the training accuracy is good for the RandomForest Classifier but there is a large difference between the training and testing accuracy so XGBoost is chosen as the model. After this a basic web application is created using flask which is integrated with the model.
